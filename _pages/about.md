ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Yk, a software engineer on a journey shaped by the diverse cultures of Singapore, Malaysia, China, and Japan. Currently, I find myself exploring the realms of AI and HCI, hoping to bridge technology with people.

In my professional journey, I've had the chance to contribute in small but meaningful ways:

- Core contributor to a [large-scale wireless VR streaming solution](https://www.lp-research.com/siggraph-los-angeles-2023/).
- Contributed to [OpenZen](https://bitbucket.org/lpresearch/openzen/src/master/), an open-sourced sensor library.
- Developed a multisensor logging program.

Additionally, I've taken part in leading and developing fullstack projects in *DeFi, eCommerce* and *web2 fields*. There are in my projects page!

ðŸ“« If you'd like to connect, drop me a message via email, Instagram, or LinkedIn. I'm always up for discussions and meeting awesome people!

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
