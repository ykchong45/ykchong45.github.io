👋 Hello! I'm ***Ken***, a master's student in Computer Engineering at UC San Diego 🏖️. 

My journey has been shaped by experiences in Singapore 🇸🇬, Malaysia 🇲🇾, China 🇨🇳, and Japan 🇯🇵, where I previously worked at [LP-Research](https://www.lp-research.com) in Tokyo 🗼 as a software engineer. Currently, I’m diving into **backend engineering**, **AI**, and **HCI**, with a focus on building technology that better connects people.

In my professional journey, I’ve contributed in several impactful ways:

- **Large-Scale VR**: Developed LPVR-AIR, a multi-user VR system deployed across multiple design centers and showcased at [SIGGRAPH 2023](https://www.lp-research.com/siggraph-los-angeles-2023/), enhancing VR's modularity and network communication.
- **Open-Source Sensor Library**: Core maintainer of [OpenZen](https://bitbucket.org/lpresearch/openzen/src/master/), an open-source sensor library for streaming data, with implementations supporting diverse projects in edge computing.
- **Decentralized Finance Platform**: Led the development of a decentralized trading platform, designing scalable backends, optimizing state management, and coordinating cross-functional teams to align with key business goals.

More details are available on my [CV](/cv).

I’ve also held leadership roles in *eCommerce* and *hackathon* projects. Check out my [projects page](/projects) for a closer look at my work.

📫 Let’s connect! Reach out via email, Instagram, or LinkedIn—I’m always open to discussing new ideas and meeting amazing people.



<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
