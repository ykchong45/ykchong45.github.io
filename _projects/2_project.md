Our platform operates on blockchain, offering a space for patients to connect and communicate. It serves as a secure and supportive forum for individuals dealing with physical or mental illnesses, enabling them to share experiences and seek assistance. Leveraging zero-knowledge proof technology, we verify accesses to the forum channels, ensuring privacy while promoting communication. This approach safeguards a secure and positive environment for communication within the community.

Our authentication process works like this:

1. Patients receive their diagnosis information from the hospital.
2. Patients send the hash value of their address and disease information, along with proof and the hospital's signature, to the smart contract.
4. The smart contract employs zk technology to verify whether the patient has the access to certain board of the forum.
5. Upon confirmation, the corresponding SBT (soulBound token) is issued to the patient's address.
6. With the obtained SBT, users gain access to the relevant channel on Hippocratic Island for communication. This SBT is not transferrable.

In this project, my role involves designing visually appealing pages and intricately connecting mechanisms that facilitate communication with the server. In addition, I have successfully implemented the social media features for this project, utilizing the Lens protocol.
