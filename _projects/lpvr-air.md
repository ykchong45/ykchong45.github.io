[ðŸ”— Blogpost on SIGGRAPH 2023 event](https://www.lp-research.com/siggraph-los-angeles-2023-lpvr-air-lp-research/)

I had an exciting week at Siggraph 2023, one of the worldâ€™s top computer graphics conferences, held in Los Angeles. At the event, Klaus and I showcased LPVR-AIR with a fun and interactive racing experience. Partnering with Optitrack, a leader in optical tracking systems, and Meptik, a creative studio, we set up a real-time racing simulation using trikes.

Attendees could hop on a trike and race on a small course we built at the exhibition. Each rider wore a Meta Quest VR headset, where they saw a vibrant, Mario Kart-like track powered by our LPVR-AIR tracking system and real-time streaming solution.

The solution that we brought to the site: we attached Optitrack active marker targets to each VR headset, allowing multiple players to race within a globally-referenced tracking volume. Instead of rendering 3D content on the standalone VR headsets, LPVR-AIR streamed the high-quality visuals wirelessly from specialized PCs. This setup allowed us to display detailed, high-polygon content on the headsets without being limited by their onboard computing power.

Thanks to everyone who visited our booth, tried the trike experience, and pedaled their way around the track!
